        "During the golden era of motorsport, the most famous and fearless drivers were sometimes equated to rock stars or Hollywood celebrities. For only the most exceptional examples, this same equation proved true for the racing cars themselves. Permanently preserved on celluloid in perhaps the most accurate depiction of sports car racing that will ever be attempted on-screen, this example co-starred in Steve McQueen’s seminal 1971 feature Le Mans, using footage shot during the 1970 Le Mans race.",
        "Adding to the Le Mans movie’s overall authenticity—a requirement personally insisted upon by McQueen—this Porsche 917 K was no mere picture car. Piloted by David Hobbs and Mike Hailwood, it was a genuine contender for victory during the real 24 Hours of Le Mans, running as high as third place before the oft-treacherous race claimed the car, with rain causing Hailwood to aquaplane and retire after 49 laps.",
        "Despite limited damage to the chassis, time constraints meant that it was more convenient for JWA to exchange this chassis with a spare one immediately available and so the Porsche factory rebuilt this example for an important customer, Team Shell Heckersbruch, for the reigning Interserie Champion Jürgen Neuhaus to race. The car performed strongly over the next three seasons against ever-more-powerful competition, before being retired at the end of 1974.",
        "Purchased by the consignor, a noted collector, in 2012, the most recent chapter in the storied history of this racing Porsche was a full restoration to its original, Gulf-liveried Le Mans coupe specification. Executed by Paul Lanzant, one of the top European racing car restorers, without regard to cost and with access to many correct and original NOS components, the results are impressive in every sensory regard, from the stunning presentation and attention to detail to the mechanical preparation that is headlined by the unmistakable symphony of the flat-12 cylinder at full revs.",
        "Making a sound unlike any other and presenting exactly as it would have done at that famous race at La Sarthe 51 years ago, the Porsche 917 K is “on the button,” maintained as if a return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, or indeed another film role, is its next event.",

        'The McLaren MP4-25, powered by the Mercedes-Benz FO 108X 2.4-litre V-8 engine, proved to be a major improvement on its predecessor, in part due to the innovative "F-duct" incorporated into the design; the system’s effect being controlled by the driver covering up a small hole in the cockpit with his left leg. The design innovation along with a host of other improvements helped reduce aerodynamic drag and allowed the car as much as an extra 6 mph (9.7 km/h) on straights.',
        "In the 14 years since his F1 baptism in Melbourne in 2007, Lewis Hamilton has competed in 270 Grands Prix, winning 98 and enjoying a further 71 podium finishes, he has amassed an incredible 100 pole positions, 3,872 points and led for over 5,170 laps; each milestone reinforcing his reputation at the very pinnacle of the sport and each achieved with recognition and thanks to his team and respect to his rivals.",
        "Now a seven-time Formula 1 World Champion and 2021 Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Lewis has become a global force across multiple arenas – a talented fashion designer, skilled musician, Hollywood tastemaker, social activist, champion for environmental change as well as the most successful Formula 1 driver of all time. Lewis Hamilton is a global icon who dynamism and passion for initiating change commands as much attention and respect crossing the finish line as he does as on red carpet of the MET Gala.",
        "The availability of this example, chassis number 25A-01, is an unrepeatable opportunity given the model’s scarcity. While client confidentiality precludes disclosing exactly how many cars exist in private ownership, its believed to be only a scarce few. As such these examples remain highly coveted and largely in private hands, unlikely to be sold in the near future. Furthermore, the McLaren-Mercedes represents a car that can still be track driven and supported by the original factory teams as part of individual Heritage departments.",

        "Competing against the Ferrari LaFerrari and McLaren P1, the Porsche 918 Spyder proved to be able to hold its own against the very best that the automotive industry could muster. Utilizing premium materials, top-quality components, and cutting-edge technology, Porsche created a car that was not only stunning in its performance, but one that was equally stunning in its looks and sheer attention to detail.",
        "Cradled in a chassis constructed almost entirely of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composite, the 918’s heart is a 90-degree V-8 based upon that found in Porsche RS Spyder LMP2 Le Mans prototypes. Thanks to its flat-plane crankshaft, titanium connection rods, four valves per cylinder, and dry-sump lubrication, it can rev to an ear-piercing 9,000 rpm. As a result, it puts out a 608 horsepower, which equates to an incredible 133 horsepower per liter of displacement.",
        "In addition to this, the 918 Spyder’s combustion engine is supported by a pair of electric motors, with one being mated to the engine itself and another providing drive to the front axle. These electric motors produce an additional 284 horsepower, bringing the 918 Spyder’s total output to 887 horsepower and 994 pound-feet of torque. All this power is managed through Porsche’s tried-and-true PDK seven-speed transmission, and its delivery can be further refined through five driving modes, ranging from full electric to “Hot Lap,” which utilizes every ounce of available performance from the powertrain. Sixty miles per hour can be reached from a standstill in under 2.5 seconds, a time faster than both the McLaren P1 and the Ferrari LaFerrari, leading towards a top speed of 211 mph. Comparing performance figures between “the big three” showed that not only was the 918 the fastest to 60 mph: It also boasted the farthest electric-only range, lowest carbon dioxide emissions, and lowest fuel consumption.",
        "Of course, the brakes utilized to bring the car to a halt are just as mighty as the 918 Spyder’s gargantuan powertrain. Massive carbon-ceramic discs sitting behind the car’s lightweight alloy wheels measure at 410 millimeters in diameter at the front with six-piston calipers and 390 millimeters in diameter at the rear with four-piston calipers. Assisting the car’s handling and downforce are a handful of active aerodynamic features, including an adjustable rear wing, a pair of under-floor flaps in the nose, and further adjustable flaps in the headlamp area.",

        "The stunning 918 offered here, serial number 238, was ordered by the consignor and delivered new to him via Porsche Centre Hong Kong on 8 January 2015. Number 238 is clad in the boisterous shade of Racing Yellow over a full Black leather interior complete with optional Acid Green details and Visual Carbon Fiber trim throughout. These bespoke details find their way to the exterior as well, with a set of Acid Green brake calipers tucked inside 20-inch “standard” alloy wheels.",

        "The consignor further specified number 238 with Visual Carbon Fiber mirrors, removable roof panels, and rear spoiler. The accompanying order documents provided by the consignor show more than twenty factory options specified, most notably the desirable front-axle lift system, “full leather” sport seats and steering wheel, glare reduction package, Burmester audio system, and electric air conditioning.",

        "In 2019, the consignor imported the car to their residence in the UK, where it was regularly maintained by authorized Porsche facilities. 238’s accompanying service booklet show that it received its four-year major service in September of 2019 at Porsche Centre Reading, then showing 1,357 miles. In June 2021, 238 was recently returned to the same facility for a complete servicing in preparation for sale.",

        "Now displaying fewer than 1,450 miles driven from new, number 238’s appealing accoutrements and lengthy list of factory specifications, single-owner history, documentation, and desirable color combination all contribute to its standing amongst the best available examples of Porsche’s 918 Spyder.",

        "Merseyside has reverberated to the sounds of racing cars as well as horses' hooves at the home of the famous Grand National steeplechase, Aintree. While the Grand Prix course is now but a memory, the smaller club circuit still hosts motorcycle racing and car sprint competitions and testing and is very much alive and well.",
        "url:https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nbv9iAbI3W4?rel=0",
        "The idea of combining horse and car racing facilities was not unique but still relatively unusual when it was first conceived at Aintree in the 1950s. Struggling to make the National Hunt course pay its way with just a few meetings a year, Aintree owner Mirabel Topham hit upon the idea of building the car course shortly after a\nvisit to Goodwood.",
        "In a something of a masterstroke, the CSI (the forerunner of today's FIA) was persuaded by Aintree officials that the new circuit would make a good home for the British Grand Prix. While it was similarly flat to windswept Silverstone and could boast only the heavy industry of Liverpool as a backdrop, Aintree's ace card was its facilities. As the racecourse was host to the largest horse race in Britain, the grandstands and spectator amenities were second-to-none and used to handling enormous crowds. It was enough to make the blazers sit up and take notice...",
        "url:https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQHF23cIyXI?rel=0",
        "The largely flat circuit measured exactly three miles and was built at a cost of _100,000 in just three months, opening in May 1954. Winding its way around the perimeter of the horse racing track for its first half, the course then ducked across the turf to run through its centre in a technical infield section. A smaller club course consisted of the interior portion only.",
        "Initially operating anti-clockwise, by the start of the 1955 season the racing direction was reversed. Aintree was awarded the British Grand Prix that year and, in jubilant scenes, Stirling Moss made history by being the first British driver to win his home race. To this day Moss does not know whether the win was earned on merit or a 'gift' from Mercedes team mate Juan-Manuel Fangio or ordered by team boss Alfred Neubauer; either way, the crowd went home satisfied.",
        "Aintree also witnessed another slice of history when it hosted the 1957 Grand Prix, with Moss and Tony Brooks winning for Vanwall - the first such success by British drivers in a British car. Further Grands Prix were held in 1959, '61 and '62, with the circuit ever-popular with spectators because it the grandstands gave undisturbed views of the whole course.",
        "Even the unrivalled facilities could not save the Grand Prix from moving south to Brands Hatch in 1964. The ever-rising speeds, lack of room for run-off areas and other safety concerns (at several points drivers found themselves aiming between concrete pillars with very little room for error as they negotiated curves) meant that the exodus was probably inevitable.",
        "Not that the Grand Prix elite were the only competitors benefiting from the Aintree course; from the very beginnings the Aintree Circuit Club (ACC) had been formed by local motor racing drivers and officials (Mrs Topham as the first President) to organise Tuesday evening testing on the Club Circuit. These events were fully marshalled and based in a former RAF dispersal hut that became the Club House. The ACC would continue be responsible for the maintenance and management of the Club Circuit until 1999. Under their watch, the pit lane was developed and Armco erected around its perimeter.",
        "The full Grand Prix course soldiered on for one more year in 1964, before Mrs Topham announced that Aintree was to be sold off for redevelopment. This proved something of a long drawn out saga, with multiple court hearings as the Topham's sought to overturn a covenant put on the land when it was acquired from the Earl of Sefton\nin 1949. This stated that Aintree could only be used for agriculture or horse-racing during his life. It took an appeal to the House of Lords to finally find in Topham Ltd's favour in 1966.",
        "Aintree was finally sold to the Walton Group owned by property developer William Davies in 1973, but planning permission was never granted for housing. Car racing continued on the short course through the 1970s, though inevitably the scale of events held became smaller and smaller. The last large-scale event was held in 1975, when Gunnar Nilsson's March-Toyota F3 car won the Blakeford Trophy.",
        "After mortgage payments were defaulted on in 1976, management of the course was passed onto bookmakers Ladbrokes, on a year-by-year basis until 1983. The ACC enjoyed an excellent working relationship with the new management and was given complete autonomy over the running of the racing circuit. In 1977, Richard Peacock (a club member) opened the",
        "",
        "Aintree Racing Driver's School, which operated on a Tuesday under the auspices of the Club with the Tuesday evening Members Testing also very healthy.",
        "In the summer of 1982, the facility was once again put up for sale, which ultimately led to the cessation of car racing. While there had always been occasional problems with errant cars causing damage to the horse racing track, the issue came to a head at one of the Tuesday evening test nights, when five minutes before the circuit closure a car went off and stuck the jump at Bechers Bend.",
        "Understandably, Ladbrokes didn't want prospective buyers to visit the circuit only to find holes in the jumps, so the ACC agreed a temporary suspension of racing and testing, although the Racing Drivers School continued to operate. Following the cessation of racing, the ACC continued to meet each week but it was not possible to\nget agreement on protection of the jumps. Bike racing was still permitted, however (presumably as it was considered less likely to cause major damage) and the Aintree Motorcycle Racing Club continues to host five meetings and one general test per year.",
        "In 1984, the ACC rebounded, organising its first Single Venue Tarmac rally at the track - something it would continue to do until 1990. In 1985, they also reintroduced sprinting to the venue and by 1991, the club was running two rounds of the British Sprint Championship _ the only club to do so, with a total of five sprints per\nyear. Saturday track days were also introduced in 1987.",
        "The economic depression in the mid 1990s saw entries drop by nearly 50%. At the same time, the Jockey Club had opened their Golf facilities and had doubled the cost of renting the track to compensate for their losses when it was closed. This had a massive effect on Club finances _ the ACC was still the only motor club still running events at Aintree - and also resulted in the closure of the racing school.",
        "In 1997 the ACC announced plans for a major event that would run on the full 3.0 mile circuit, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the historic 1957 GP at Aintree. Sadly, these had to be cancelled at short notice due to difficulties with the racecourse management and, with no income generated, the club had event liabilities it\ncouldn't meet and stopped trading in 1998.",
        "Members of ACC reversed into Liverpool Motor Club - which up to that point only had one paid up member - and took over the running of the Sprints and Track days. Once the ACC had cleared its debts, however, it rebounded by successfully organising the Aintree Festival of Motorsport in 2004, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Grand Prix track. This attracted over 250 historically significant racing cars with a combined value of over _100 million, boosted by two Gala Dinners hosted by Sir Stirling Moss, Tony Brooks and Roy Salvadori. Over 20,000 racing fans turned out in freezing but sunny November weather.",
        "Shortly after this, the bulldozers moved in to start the Aintree redevelopment programme, which involved the building of two new starts for the horses on the outside of the historic Tatts Corner, the long right-hander which leads onto the historic start/finish straight. Despite this, apart from a flower bed built over the Melling Crossing and the slight encroachment of a tractor shed on the approach to Tatts, the Grand Prix course remains in its entirety. Gates bar the way at several points and speed humps make for slow progress elsewhere but, some of the Grand Prix loop still sees action once a year _ as the television camera car races alongside the horses during the Grand National!",
        "The ACC continues to promote and support the heritage of the circuit. There is also strong manufacturer interest for car launches, filming and other car-related events and the ACC regularly works with media channels to facilitate the production of TV programmes, trips and visits.",
